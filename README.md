# 3-Fruits-Detection

This repository contains a trained classifier that can detect 3 types of fruits namely Apple, Banana and Orange. To run the classifier, just download the zip file, extract it. Then run the object_detection_image.py or the object_detection_video.py files present in the object_detection directory.

If you run the object_detection_image.py file, then changing the string in IMAGE_NAME variable in  line 34 to the required image name will help to run the classifier on that image. But for that, you must put that image in the object_detection directory. Otherwise, a default image name is added in line 34 and that image is present in the directory. So you can just run the code and get the output after 20-30 seconds.

Similarly, for the object_detection_video.py file you need to change the string in the variable named VIDEO_NAME (present in line 35). The process is similar to the previously mentioned one.
